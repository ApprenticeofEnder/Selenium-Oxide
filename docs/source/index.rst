Selenium Oxide is a web exploitation automation framework designed 
around the needs of penetration testers and attack/defense CTF players 
alike! When Requests isn't enough, or if you don't want to worry about 
spoofing headers, this is an excellent alternative!

The module offers a slimmer API than standard Selenium, and has 
multiple handy features, such as:

* Stealth functionality
* Builder pattern exploit writing
* Automatic browser binary configuration
* Cookie dumping

Planned features include:

* Payload generation
* Flexible selection options (tags, CSS, etc.)
* More as suggested or encountered in field testing

Why the Name?
=============

When making this module I initially struggled with 
what to call it. I happened to look at another module,
named Selenium Wire, and decided yeah, you know what, 
using Selenium in the name is fair game. Selenium Oxide 
sounded cool, and when I looked up information on the 
chemical it read that it was at least somewhat dangerous.

A dangerous version of Selenium. Checks out for an offsec 
platform.
